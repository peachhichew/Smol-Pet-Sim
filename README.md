# Project #4 Proposal

### Project description

For this project, I plan to make an online pet simulator, something similar to a koi fish pond widget on a web browser. The landing page will simply showcase the three types of pets: dogs, cats, and rabbits (each are clickable for their respective pages), have a “start” button, and a link to Credits and Notes. As for the three interactive pages, each page will have a specific type of pet and there will be page-specific mouse click/drag and/or keyboard interactions available. For example, in the Dogs page, I am planning to implement a mouse click event where if the user clicks on a dog, the browser will display the dog in the sitting animation. If the user drags a dog, the running animation will continue at the mouse location. In the Cats page, there will be a bunch of random cats in different poses. If the user clicks on a cat, he/she will be able to move the cat around using the arrow keys. The cats will also vary in size to create a sense of depth. Lastly, the Rabbits page will first feature one rabbit and gradually increase in numbers as the user clicks on the “More Rabbits” button. A “grow” button will also be implemented on each page to increase the size of each sprite. All buttons will be canvas-based.

### To Learn

First off, to make the project successful, I will need to learn the syntax for the Pixi.js library. I decided to go with this library over the others since I liked how intuitive it was for me and the fact that it was good for rendering images made it even more appealing. I will also need to learn how to animate sprites through a finite state machine in JavaScript and figure out how to use the FSM to access specific frames of the sprite (i.e. accessing the sleeping frames versus the walking ones). Lastly, this is something I am slightly shaky on since I am inexperienced with JavaScript, but hooking up events with custom functions is something I plan on re-learning and understanding completely. I am aware of how the syntax works, but I have not written a custom function that isn’t for an exercise so it is currently a matter of putting the pieces together. To accomplish all these points, I will be primarily using kittykatattack’s Learning Pixi GitHub repository, the Pixi.js examples page, and Open Game Art for syntax reference and sprites.
